# Rocket-Flight-Simulation-V2

2-DOF Rocket Flight Simulation in Matlab/Simulink including engine thrust, drag, lift and wind (external factors and more)

---

After my old flight simulation, I improved myself a little more in this field and made a more functional and advanced version of this simulation. 

You can reach my old Rocket Flight Simulation [here](https://github.com/embeddedJedi/Basic_Rocket-Flight-Simulation/tree/main).

`Note: There may still be some errors or omissions. I will continue to update and upload new projects as I continue my work.`
